\chapter{Magic}

Idea for magic: connect cosmogony (the science of the creation of the universe)
to magic. Magic as an expression of scientific knowledge. Could set up Platonic
forms as the ``true'' nature reality, perfect but unattanaile through any
thought process, as they can never be directly observed.

Magic, in a way, is set up to resemble mathematical modeling.
